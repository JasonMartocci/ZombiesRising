What about the men's toys? This post we want to shed some light on the toys that make the men in the world "stand up" and cheer.<br /><br /> We tested, played, tested and played some more.

Men will stick there willies in just about anything to achieve an orgasm. Socks, foods, vacuum hoses, between the mattress, paper towel rolls... the list goes on. If you masturbate at all, buying an inexpensive male masturbator is absolutely worth it.<br /><br /> Prostate stimulators are a little different and might be a little extra taboo to some men.
